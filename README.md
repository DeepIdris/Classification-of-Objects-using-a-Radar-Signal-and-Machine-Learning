# Classification-of-Objects-using-a-Radar-Signal-and-Machine-Learning

A practical executed to classify objects using a radar signal and machine learning. Data was provided which contains a part
that labeled and another which wasnâ€™t labeled. The aim of the practical is to develop a good machine learning model using the 
labeled data to generalize on new data, in this case, the unlabeled data. The data are of two types, one for binary classification,
that is, two labels/outputs and multiclass classification, that is, more than two labels/outputs. The models with the best 
performance in each case will be used to predict on the unlabeled data.

Data was provided by Harris-Birtill, D. (PhD), which is part of a University internal project.
